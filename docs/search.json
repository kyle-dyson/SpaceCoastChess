In the above example, style=display: block; margin: 0; auto; serves to center the image. Taking display: block out and changing the margin: to 0 0 will default to left-alignment within the part of the page (container) the image resides in.\n\nNote: the above image is broken because the file for the image is not associated with this markdown file. In other words, R.ico on line 89 doesn’t exist.\n\n\nFile-Defined CSS\nCreate a *.css file that your R Markdown document can refer to.\nLet’s say we want to make every link dodgerblue.\nLinks in HTML are tagged with the letter a, and to insert a link with HTML you can do something like:\n<a href='https://m-clark.github.io>wowee zowee!</a>\nIt would look like this: wowee zowee!. If we want to change the color from the default setting for all links, we go into our CSS file.\na { color: dodgerblue; } Now our links would look like this: wowee zowee!\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    css: mystyle.css\nNow every link you create will be that color. We could add a subtle background to it, make them bold or whatever.\na { color: dodgerblue; background-color: #f2f2f2; font-weight: 800; } Now it becomes wowee zowee!. In a similar fashion, you could make images always display at 50% width by default.\nimg { width: 50%; }"
